Here’s a `README.md` you can use for your **Sentiment Analysis Web App with FastAPI and HTML frontend**:

# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Web App (FastAPI + HTML)

This project is a sentiment analysis web application that uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the **Sentiment140** dataset. Users can input a tweet/message through a simple HTML form and receive a prediction: **Positive 😊** or **Negative 😞**.

## 🚀 Features

- Logistic Regression trained on the Sentiment140 dataset
- Custom preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, stemming)
- Frequency-based feature extraction
- HTML frontend served using FastAPI and Jinja2
- REST API endpoint for predicting sentiment

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Jinja2
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Dataset: [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/)


## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-fastapi-app.git
cd sentiment-fastapi-app
````

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Tweets are cleaned (URLs, mentions, hashtags removed), converted to lowercase, stop words removed, and stemmed.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Each tweet is converted into a vector `[1, pos_freq, neg_freq]`.
3. **Prediction**: The trained logistic regression model returns a probability of positivity using a sigmoid function.

## 📝 Example

**Input**:

```
I love this new course!
```

**Output**:

```
Sentiment: Positive 😊
```
